  abstract={A new X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) full-field imaging station has been developed, installed and tested on beamline ID21 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The set-up operates in the 2-9 keV energy range and allows for the simultaneous acquisition of up to 4.10 6 XANES spectra over large sample areas with preserved sub-micron spatial resolution. The versatile set-up is compatible with various types of cameras and magnifying objectives. It accommodates spatial resolutions ranging from 0.3 ?m to 1.4 ?m and fields of view from 600 ?m up to 2 mm. The range of potential applications is broad: from geology, cultural heritage, environmental sciences to medicine.}

  abstract={2D area detectors like CCD or pixel detectors have become popular in the last 15 years for diffraction experiments (e.g. for WAXS, SAXS, single crystal and powder diffraction (XRPD)). These detectors have a large sensitive area of millions of pixels with high spatial resolution. The software package pyFAI has been designed to reduce SAXS, WAXS and XRPD images taken with those detectors into 1 D curves (azimuthal integration) usable by other software for in-depth analysis such as Rietveld refinement, or 2 D images (a radial transformation named caking ). As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated into other tools like PyMca or EDNA with a clean pythonic interface. However pyFAI features also command line tools for batch processing, converting data into q-space (q being the momentum transfer) or 2 ? -space ( ? being the Bragg angle) and a calibration graphical interface for optimizing the geometry of the experiment using the Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference sample. PyFAI shares the geometry definition of SPD but can directly import geometries determined by the software FIT2D. PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and relies on FabIO, a library able to read more than 20 image formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers. During the transformation from cartesian space (x,y) to polar space (2?, ?), both local and total intensities are conserved in order to obtain accurate quantitative results. Technical details on how this integration is implemented and how it has been ported to native code and parallelized on graphic cards are discussed in this paper.}

 abstract = {A method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features in an image and a further method and apparatus for using such scale invariant features to locate an object in an image are disclosed. The method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features may involve the use of a processor circuit for producing a plurality of component subregion descriptors for each subregion of a pixel region about pixel amplitude extrema in a plurality of difference images produced from the image. This may involve producing a plurality of difference images by blurring an initial image to produce a blurred image and by subtracting the blurred image from the initial image to produce the difference image. For each difference image, pixel amplitude extrema are located and a corresponding pixel region is defined about each pixel amplitude extremum. Each pixel region is divided into subregions and a plurality of component subregion descriptors are produced for each subregion. These component subregion descriptors are correlated with component subregion descriptors of an image under consideration and an object is indicated as being detected when a sufficient number of component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) define an aggregate correlation exceeding a threshold correlation with component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) associated with the object.}
